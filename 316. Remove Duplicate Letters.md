# Problem: Remove Duplicate Letters

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```
s = "bcabc"
```
**Output:**
```
"abc"
```

#### Example 2
**Input:**
```
s = "cbacdcbc"
```
**Output:**
```
"acdb"
```

## Solution Approach

### Algorithm
1. Create a vector `lastSeenIndex` to store the last occurrence index of each character.
2. Traverse the string and update the `lastSeenIndex` for each character.
3. Use a stack to build the result string, ensuring it satisfies the following conditions:
   - Characters in the stack are in lexicographical order.
   - Characters appear only once.
4. Iterate through the string:
   - Skip characters already present in the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty and the current character is smaller than the stack's top element, check if the top element will appear later. If yes, pop it from the stack.
   - Push the current character into the stack and mark it as seen.
5. Convert the stack into the final string and reverse it to get the correct order.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicateLetters(string s) {
        vector<int> lastSeenIndex(26, -1);

        // Update the last occurrence index of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            lastSeenIndex[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }

        vector<bool> seen(26, false);
        stack<char> st;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int currChar = s[i] - 'a';

            // Skip if character is already seen
            if (seen[currChar]) continue;

            // Maintain lexicographical order in the stack
            while (!st.empty() && s[i] < st.top() && i < lastSeenIndex[st.top() - 'a']) {
                seen[st.top() - 'a'] = false;
                st.pop();
            }

            // Push current character into stack and mark as seen
            st.push(s[i]);
            seen[currChar] = true;
        }

        // Construct the final result string
        string ans;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            ans += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }

        // Reverse to get correct order
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string. Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) additional space (excluding the stack and result storage).

### Notes
- This approach ensures that the resulting string is the smallest in lexicographical order while maintaining each character's uniqueness.
- Using a stack helps to efficiently manage the order and uniqueness constraints.
