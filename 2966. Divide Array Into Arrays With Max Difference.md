# Problem: Divide Array into Groups of Size 3

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

1. Each element of `nums` should be in exactly one array.
2. The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to `k`.

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```
nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```
[[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
```

#### Example 2
**Input:**
```
nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3
```
**Output:**
```
[]
```

## Solution Approach

### Algorithm
1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Iterate through the array in steps of 3.
   - Check if the difference between the smallest and largest element in the group is \( \leq k \).
   - If valid, create a subarray of size 3 and add it to the result.
   - If invalid, clear the result and return an empty 2D array as it is impossible to divide the array.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> divideArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
         sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
         vector<vector<int>> ans;

         for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i += 3) {
             if (i + 2 >= nums.size() || nums[i + 2] - nums[i] > k) { // Check validity
                 ans.clear();  // Violation of condition
                 return ans;   // Return empty 2D vector
             }
             vector<int> temp = {nums[i], nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2]};
             ans.push_back(temp);
         }
         
         return ans;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \log n) \) for sorting the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) additional space, excluding the result storage.

---

### Notes
- If the array size is not a multiple of 3, it is impossible to divide it into valid groups, and the function will return an empty array.
- Sorting ensures that the groups are formed in increasing order, simplifying the process of checking the difference condition.
